Updates
-------
- 2016/04/12 - A few weeks ago the kernel *3.10.86* sources shipped with betas B5** have been released. I managed to compile the kernel with the CM13 but the phone doesn't boot the system and `logcat` is impossible. I'm investigating why this happens.

- 2015/10/28 - This project is stuck because a **Board Support Package** for *Hisilicon Kirin 925* and *MaliT628* **IS MISSING**. Android's surfaceflinger needs patches to work with huawei gralloc and mali userspace binaries. I hope Huawei will soon release the sources needed.
